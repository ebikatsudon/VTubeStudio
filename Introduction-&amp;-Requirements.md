## Basics

VTube Studio is an app available for **[iPhone/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vtube-studio/id1511435444)**, **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.denchi.vtubestudio)**, **[macOS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/)** and **[Windows](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/)**. The app uses your smartphone or webcam to track your face and animate a [Live2D Cubism Model](https://www.live2d.com/en/) accordingly. 3D models are not supported. The model is shown directly on your phone or on your PC by streaming the face-tracking data over your local network from your phone to your PC/Mac.
