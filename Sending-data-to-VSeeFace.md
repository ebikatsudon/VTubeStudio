You can use VTube Studio on your iPhone/iPad to send blendshape tracking data to [VSeeFace](https://www.vseeface.icu/) running on your PC, taking advantage of the high-quality iPhone tracking for your 3D models. This functionality is included in iOS version of VTube Studio **completely for free**, so you don't have to buy the PRO version if you want to use this feature (any support is of course appreciated regardless).

## What's VSeeFace?

VSeeFace is a free, highly configurable face and hand tracking VRM and [VSFAvatar](https://www.vseeface.icu/#vsfavatar) avatar puppeteering program for **3D Virtual YouTubers** (as opposed to Live2D) with a focus on robust tracking and high image quality, made by Emiliana ([@emiliana_vt](https://twitter.com/emiliana_vt)).

It mainly uses webcam tracking to control 3D VTuber avatars but has recently added support for high-quality iPhone tracking using various 3rd party apps, including VTube Studio.

If you are a 3D VTuber and have an iPhone, definitely give VSeeFace a try!!

## How do I use VTube Studio to control my 3D model in VSeeFace?

First, set up your 3D model like you normally would in VSeeFace. No special setup is required. All iOS blendshapes are supported when using VSeeFace with VTube Studio on your iPhone/iPad.
