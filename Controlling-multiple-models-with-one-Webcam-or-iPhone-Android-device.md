## Preparation

You can use one webcam or iPhone/Android device to control multiple VTube Studio instances.

To do that, you first have to start VTube Studio multiple times. You can do that using this button:

</p>
<br/>

Alternatively, use the `start_without_steam.bat` file next to the main VTube Studio `.exe` file, see ["Starting VTube Studio without Steam"](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Starting-without-Steam). Now you have VTube Studio running multiple times.

## Using one webcam to control multiple VTube Studio Instances

You can just select the same webcam multiple times in VTube Studio. The tracking will only be executed once, so there is no performance overhead when using the same webcam for multiple models.
