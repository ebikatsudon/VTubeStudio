## Preparation

You can use one webcam or iPhone/Android device to control multiple VTube Studio instances.

To do that, you first have to start VTube Studio multiple times. You can do that using this button:

</p>
<br/>

Alternatively, use the `start_without_steam.bat` file next to the main VTube Studio `.exe` file, see ["Starting VTube Studio without Steam"](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Starting-without-Steam). Now you have VTube Studio running multiple times.
