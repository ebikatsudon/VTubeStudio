The main use-case of VTube Studio is to use your smartphone for face tracking, render your model in the Mac/PC app and then use OBS (or recording similar software) to stream to YouTube or Twitch. Any Windows/Mac recording software should work with VTube Studio. 

If you use an iPhone/iPad for tracking, you can use WiFi or USB to stream the face tracking data to the PC app. On Android, you can only use WiFi.


      VTube Studio uses your local network (TCP/UDP) or USB to send face tracking data from
       your smartphone to your PC or Mac. Depending on your home network setup, there may
       Be connection issues, most frequently caused by your firewall configuration. For more info,

## Streaming per WiFi - Preparation on PC/Mac

Streaming the face tracking data from your smartphone to PC/Mac is easy. First, make sure both your smartphone and PC/Mac are on the same local network, otherwise they will not be able to see each other.

Then, start the desktop app. In the settings, you can activate the server after choosing a port (try leaving the default port first, 25565).
