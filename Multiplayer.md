**VNet** is VTube Studio's built-in **online collaboration functionality**, available as paid DLC for Windows and macOS.

You can buy it here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384550

* It works for **up to 4 people** per collab session.
* You HAVE to **start VTube Studio through Steam** to use VNet.
* Any models and items (including Live2D Items) you load are **automatically synced to other participants**. There are currently no restrictions as to how many you can load.
* With this, your collab participants will **show up directly in your VTS**, so you no longer have to deal with bad collab video quality.
* You can even **pin other participants' models to yourself**.
* Movement data is sent between participants via the Steam P2P network, so you have to be logged into Steam to use this and the person hosting the collab has to be **Steam-friends** with all participants.
