Starting VTube Studio as administrator on Windows can solve some issues, such as hotkeys not working when VTube Studio is not in focus.

Also, VTube Studio will attempt to set its GPU priority to `high` when started as admin. It's recommended to always start VTube Studio as admin.

To start VTube Studio as admin, find the `.exe file`, right click it, click `"Properties"`, go to the `"Compatibility"` tab and check `"Run this program as an administrator"`.

Then start VTS normally using Steam or the `"start_without_steam.bat"` file.
