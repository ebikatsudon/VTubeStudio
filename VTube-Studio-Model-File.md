## VTube Studio Models

All files VTube Studio generates to save your model setup and meta data are fully human-readable, not encrypted and use a JSON format.

Currently, VTube Studio saves all model-related configuration data in a file right next to your Live2D model. The file is called:

**\<Your-Live2D-Model-Name\>.vtube.json**

There is no documentation available for the file format at this point, but if youâ€™re interested, just open them up in your favorite text editor. Most things should be relatively self-explanatory. But please be advised that manipulating your model fines manually may result in broken files so please be careful.

## Auto-backups

When you modify any model settings in VTube Studio, the model file is automatically saved instantly. Also, VTube Studio checks every 5 minutes if the currently loaded model was modified and if it was, it saves a safety-copy into the `"Backups"` folder next to the `"Live2DModels"` folder.
