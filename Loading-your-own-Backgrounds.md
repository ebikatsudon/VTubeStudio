VTube Studio comes with a few default backgrounds. Some of them are animated backgrounds that can't be added or removed (for example the doggo one).

The Steam app also comes with a color-picker-background, pictured below. Using this background, you can also activate **"Transparent Mode"**, which will enable OBS and other capture software to record your model with a transparent background, so you donâ€™t need to use a color key.

You can freely add backgrounds (videos or images) to VTube Studio. Be careful when using videos with a large file size in the mobile app as they could potentially crash the app due to memory limitations.

Supported formats are:

* **Image**
  * .jpg
  * .png
* **Video**
  * .mp4
  * .webm (may not be supported on some platforms)

The backgrounds-folder can be found in the following locations. You may need to restart the app after adding your own backgrounds.
