VTube Studio lets you upload and download content using the **Steam Workshop**.

Currently, you can upload models and [items](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Item-System) to the [Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/1325860/workshop/).

## Workshop Rules

You can share any content on the VTube Studio Steam Workshop as long as you follow these rules:

* Do not share content that you are now allowed to share.
* Do not share copyrighted content.
* Do not share any sexual content or content containing explicit nudity. If it can't be shown on Twitch, do not upload it to the Workshop.

If your content breaks these rules, it may be banned from the Workshop.
