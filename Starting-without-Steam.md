VTube Studio is only available via Steam and all updates will distributed that way. However, once downloaded, **you can start VTube Studio without Steam**.

You can even start VTube Studio multiple times using the `start_without_steam.bat` file. Then you can use multiple webcams or multiple smartphones to control the models. You can also use one webcam to control multiple instances of VTube Studio.

When you start VTube Studio multiple times, the windows will have different titles (Windows-only, not supported on macOS) so they can easily be captured separately by OBS. Do not start multiple VTS instances consecutively too fast, otherwise this will not work and they will all have the same title.

You can now use multiple webcams or smartphones (on different ports) to control the different VTube Studio instances. You can also support one webcam in multiple VTube Studio instances so they use the same tracking data. In that case, the face tracking is only executed once for that camera so there is no additional CPU overhead.
