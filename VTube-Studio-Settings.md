## Settings File

After clicking the settings icon (gear icon) in the main menu, the settings screen will be shown. It has several tabs, a help icon (links to this manual) and a language selector button that lets you change the interface language (app restart needed).

Global (not related to a specific model) setting are saved in this file:<br/>

`<VTS-App-Path>/VTube Studio_Data/StreamingAssets/Config/vts_config.json`<br/>
