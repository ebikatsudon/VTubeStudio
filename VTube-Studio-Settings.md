## Settings File

After clicking the settings icon (gear icon) in the main menu, the settings screen will be shown. It has several tabs, a help icon (links to this manual) and a language selector button that lets you change the interface language (app restart needed).

Global (not related to a specific model) setting are saved in this file:<br/>

`<VTS-App-Path>/VTube Studio_Data/StreamingAssets/Config/vts_config.json`<br/>

From here, you can purchase **VTube Studio PRO (iOS/Android only)**. On iOS, there is also a button to restore purchases on this screen.

Furthermore, there are some general settings for hiding the VTS logo, remembering the scene (save open background and model when restarting), etc.

Next, thereâ€™s the "Stream to PC" setup. This is for connecting your phone to your PC to stream the face tracking data to the PC app. This will be covered in the chapter **"Connecting your Smartphone to your PC/Mac"**. On iOS devices, you can also start an USB connection as alternative to WiFi here. This is recommended as it seems to be more reliable/stable than WiFi. On Android, this option is unfortunately not available.

Finally, there's the "Mouse Input Config". This allows you to use the mouse/finger position as input parameter to animate your model in addition to face tracking. You can select an **X-Range** and **Y-Range** in pixels. This range will be mapped to [-1, 1] for X and Y. With this setting, you could for example make your model follow your finger or mouse pointer with its eyes. This will also show mouse-clicks (right, left, middle) that can be used to trigger hotkeys. In the smartphone app, these mouse-clicks can be triggered by touching the screen with one finger (left-click), two fingers (right-click) and three fingers (middle-click).
