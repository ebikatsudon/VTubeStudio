**Note: To use plugins, you currently have to use the VTube Studio Beta. See [Discord](https://discord.gg/VTubeStudio) for more info.**

VTube Studio supports third-party **plugins** using the **VTube Studio API**. Some stuff plugins can do:
* Activate hotkeys (for example via Twitch donations, YouTube superchats, ...)
* Control face tracking parameters and control the model
* Move the model, scale and rotate it
* ...and more!!

_Plugins cannot access your webcam or read any personal data through VTS._

## Some examples of VTS plugins

For info on how to use those plugins, please check out the linked plugin websites. **Important: These plugins are UNOFFICIAL and are not developed by DenchiSoft. Please only use plugins you trust!!**
