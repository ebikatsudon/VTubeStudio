**Note: To use plugins, you currently have to use the VTube Studio Beta. Plugins are not supported on smartphones. See [Discord](https://discord.gg/VTubeStudio) for more info.**

VTube Studio supports third-party **plugins** using the **VTube Studio API**. Some stuff plugins can do:
* Activate hotkeys (for example via Twitch donations, YouTube superchats, ...)
* Control face tracking parameters and control the model.
* Add entirely new tracking parameters and inject data for them, allowing for literally anything to control your model (software, game controllers, ...)
* Move the model, scale and rotate it.
* ...and more!!

A plugin could be an app running on your PC/Mac or even just a website that takes control of VTS running on your PC!!

_Plugins cannot access your webcam or read any personal data through VTS._

## Some examples of VTS plugins

For info on how to use those plugins, please check out the linked plugin websites. **Important: These plugins are UNOFFICIAL and are not developed by DenchiSoft. Please only use plugins you trust!!**
