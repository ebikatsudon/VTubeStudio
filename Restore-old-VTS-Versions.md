Starting with **VTube Studio 1.26.11**, you will be able to restore old versions of VTube Studio on Steam (macOS and Windows). This will be possible for versions of VTube Studio released **after June 14th, 2023**.

In general, I would recommend always staying on the newest version and reporting any bugs you find in the [VTube Studio Discord](https://discord.gg/VTubeStudio) so they can be fixed as soon as possible. But in some emergency situations, it can make sense to do a temporary rollback to an old version that worked better for you.

Keep in mind that for [VNet Multiplayer](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Multiplayer) to work properly, all collab participants should be on the same VTube Studio version.

If you are on an **old version** branch of VTube Studio, **Steam will no longer automatically update VTube Studio** and you will **not receive any further updates and bugfixes** until you switch back to the normal public version.

There is also no guarantee that these old Steam versions will stay compatible with **VNet** and the **iOS** and **Android** apps forever.

## How do I restore old versions?

⚠️ **Important:** Before switching to an old version, make safety copies of all your models, items and backgrounds!! That means make copies of your `Live2DModels`, `Items` and `Backgrounds` folders somewhere outside of the VTube Studio Steam folder. Switching versions will not delete any files, but it's best to be on the safe side since there HAVE been reports of Steam updates randomly deleting model files!! ⚠️ 

Old versions are available as **Steam beta branches**.

In your Steam game library, right-click `VTube Studio` and select `Properties...` → `Betas`. There, you will find a dropdown list showing old versions.

You can change back to the normal branch at any time by selecting `None` as beta.

And again, please make sure to have safety copies of all your assets BEFORE attempting to switch to old versions of VTube Studio.
