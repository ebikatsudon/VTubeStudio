Starting with **VTube Studio 1.26.11**, you will be able to restore old versions of VTube Studio on Steam (macOS and Windows).

In general, I would recommend always staying on the newest version and reporting any bugs you find so they can be fixed. But in some emergency situations, it can make sense to do a temporary rollback to an old version that worked better for you.

Keep in mind that for [VNet Multiplayer](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Multiplayer) to work properly, all collab participants should be on the same VTube Studio version.
