Starting with **VTube Studio 1.26.11**, you will be able to restore old versions of VTube Studio on Steam (macOS and Windows).

In general, I would recommend always staying on the newest version and reporting any bugs you find in the [VTube Studio Discord](https://discord.gg/VTubeStudio) so they can be fixed as soon as possible. But in some emergency situations, it can make sense to do a temporary rollback to an old version that worked better for you.

Keep in mind that for [VNet Multiplayer](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Multiplayer) to work properly, all collab participants should be on the same VTube Studio version.

If you are on an **old version** branch of VTube Studio, **Steam will no longer automatically update VTube Studio** and you will **not receive any further updates and bugfixes** until you switch back to the normal public version.
