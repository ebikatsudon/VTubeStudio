# How safe is VNet?

In general, if you don't trust the other collab participants you should not use this, as they could use specialized software to steal your model during collabs. This is true for VNet and any other collab application that shares your models with other participants. People outside the collab cannot steal your model.

VNet is just one more tool you can use in your collabs. In many cases, using video-sharing-based tools like [VDO.Ninja](https://vdo.ninja/), [Discord](https://discord.com/), [ping.gg](https://ping.gg/) or [MultiV](https://iv.gg/multiv/login) is the right choice.
