**Note:** ArtMeshes are parts of your model. They're basically the layers in the base PSD for your model. Some settings can be customized per ArtMesh for your model.

The following functionality can be customized/added per ArtMesh for Live2D models:

* Exclude items from pinning to the ArtMesh.
* Select ArtMeshes that delete items from the scene when you drop them on there.
* Customize how the [Display Light Overlay System](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Display-Light-Overlay) affects the ArtMesh.

This will be described in a bit more detail in the following sections.
