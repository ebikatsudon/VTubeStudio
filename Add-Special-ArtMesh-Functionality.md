**Note:** ArtMeshes are parts of your model. They're basically the layers in the base PSD for your model. Some settings can be customized per ArtMesh for your model.

## Customizing ArtMesh functionality for your Model

You can add functionality to individual ArtMeshes in your model by first loading the model and then accessing the following menu.

The following functionality can be customized/added per ArtMesh for Live2D models:

* Exclude items from pinning to the ArtMesh.
* Select ArtMeshes that delete items from the scene when you drop them on there.
* Customize how the [Display Light Overlay System](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Display-Light-Overlay) affects the ArtMesh.

This will be described in a bit more detail in the following sections.

### Exclude items from pinning to the ArtMesh

You can pin items (PNGs, GIFs, etc.) to your Live2D model, see "[[Item System]]". Sometimes, you may want to exclude parts of your model from this and make sure items can't pin to them. Usually that's ArtMeshes like blushes, semi-transparent or invisible overlays and so on. You can do so by turning them off in the list.

### Select ArtMeshes that delete items from the scene when you drop them on there

You can select ArtMeshes that delete any items that are dropped on them. You could for example use that for your mouth-related ArtMeshes to make your model "eat" items.

### Customize how the Display Light Overlay System affects the ArtMesh

With the [Display Light Overlay System](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Display-Light-Overlay), you can overlay your model with the color from a game, video, etc.

You can customize how much this system affects parts of the model. Using this customization, you could for example make parts of your model (like the eyes) stand out more by making them "glow in the dark".
