## What are Live2D Items?

In addition to [normal PNG, JPG and animated assets](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Item-System) (GIF, etc.), VTube Studio now supports adding Live2D-props into the scene. You can also attach them to your model. With this, you can create props that react to face-tracking, have physics and can even have their own hotkeys to trigger expressions and animations in the prop Live2D models.

You could for example have animated hats, guns that aim depending on your face angle and shoot when you click with your mouse or glasses that properly rotate with your head.

When set up correctly, their physics setup will also react when theyâ€™re attached to your model and your model moves them.
