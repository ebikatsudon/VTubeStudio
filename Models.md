Got some questions about what **VTuber model types** are supported in **VTube Studio**? Or are you **looking for models to use**? This page will get you started.

# What models can I use in VTube Studio?

VTube Studio **ONLY supports Live2D Models**.

Other formats like VRoid/VRM are not supported. VTube Studio **DOES NOT support ANY 3D models**. For 3D models, you could check out VSeeFace: https://www.vseeface.icu/

# Where can I get Live2D models? Or how can I make them?

Generally, Live2D models aren't free. You have to commission an artist to draw the art for your model and then you have to commission a Live2D rigger to create the model using that art. This process typically takes weeks to months and full models can cost anywhere between a few 100 to a few 1000 USD since they are made from scratch by skilled artists based on your requests.

VTube Studio **DOES NOT** have a built-in model creator.

If you want to commission a model, a good place to look for artists and riggers would be the Live2D Discord: https://discord.gg/Live2D

If you already have your model art want to make your model yourself, you can download Live2D Cubism from here: https://www.live2d.com/en/

There are a lot of tutorials on YouTube to get you started with Live2D Cubism.

# Can I get Live2D models for free?

If you want to become a (Live2D) VTuber, it's best to have a model that you identify with, so typically an original character you created. Using free sample models from the internet might not give you the experience you're looking for. 

But if you just want to try out VTubing and you're looking for models to try out in VTube Studio, you can take a look at some of the official Live2D sample models: https://www.live2d.com/en/

Alternatively, if you want to become a 3D VTuber, you could take a look at apps like VRoid that let you easily create 3D VTuber models which can be used in apps like VSeeFace: https://vroid.com/en
