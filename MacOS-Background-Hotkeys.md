VTube Studio supports hotkey activation on macOS even when the VTube Studio window is not in focus.

For this to work, you'll have to grant VTube Studio the "accessibility" permission on macOS.

If this permission isn't granted, VTube Studio will show a warning popup and ask you to grant it. You can also grant it manually like this:

* Open macOS system settings
* **Privacy & Security**  =>  **Accessibility**  => **Add VTube Studio to list and make sure toggle button is on**
* Restart VTube Studio if it was running.
