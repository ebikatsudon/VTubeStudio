## Basics

VTube Studio is an app available for **[iPhone/iPad](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vtube-studio/id1511435444)**, **[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.denchi.vtubestudio)**, **[macOS](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/)** and **[Windows](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325860/VTube_Studio/)**. The app uses your smartphone or webcam to track your face and animate a [Live2D Cubism Model](https://www.live2d.com/en/) accordingly. 3D models are not supported. The model is shown directly on your phone or on your PC by streaming the face-tracking data over your local network from your phone to your PC/Mac.

**VTUBE STUDIO ONLY SUPPORTS LIVE2D MODELS. VROID/VRM IS NOT SUPPORTED. [PLEASE USE OTHER APPS LIKE VSEEFACE FOR THAT. YOU CAN USE VTUBE STUDIO TO CONTROL YOUR MODELS IN VSEEFACE USING HIGH QUALITY IOS TRACKING](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Sending-data-to-VSeeFace/).**
