Two things should be implemented as part of this.

1) Saving/Loading item scenes using the UI.
2) Loading items using hotkeys.


# Basic item persistence

* Items should be saved at their respective positions, including items attached to the Live2D model. 
* This should only happen if `"Remember Scene"` is active in the VTube Studio config.
