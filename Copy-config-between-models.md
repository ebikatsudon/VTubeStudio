You can copy the VTube Studio configuration from one model to another. This can be useful if you have multiple models with similar Live2D parameters.

You can access this menu from within the **"Auto Setup"** menu. First, load the **model you want to copy from**. Then go to **"Auto Setup"** and select **"Copy setup from other model"**. This will show a list of all models in VTube Studio and you can **select one to copy from**.
