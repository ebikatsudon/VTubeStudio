## Webcam Tracking

Any webcam will do, but better picture quality means better tracking. Generally, a resolution of 1280x720 or above is recommended for good eye- and blink-tracking. Framerates between 15-30 FPS are sufficient for good tracking. DSLR cameras can be used, but some users have reported problems when using DSLRs, so proceed with caution.
