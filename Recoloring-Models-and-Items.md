**Only use this with permission from your model artist. Many artists do not want their art to be modified or recolored in any way and consider it rude, so please ask your artist before using this feature and always respect their wishes!!**

## Recoloring your Model

You can recolor all ArtMeshes (parts of the model) in your main VTube Studio model and any [Live2D items](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Live2D-Items) you load into the scene. You can also use hotkeys to save/load recoloring presets. **Please get permission from your artist first before doing any of this.**

To recolor ArtMeshes of your currently loaded model, open the model settings tab and click **"Customize Model"**. Then, choose **"Customize multiply/screen color for ArtMeshes"**.

This will let you set multiply and screen overlay colors for every ArtMesh. These color changes are saved with your model and loaded the next time you reload the model as well.

## Recoloring your Live2D Items

Doing the same for Live2D items is also easy. For more info on how to do that, check the page on Live2D items: https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Live2D-Items

## Saving Color Presets and Loading them via Hotkeys

You can also use **Hotkeys** to load these screen/multiply color presets for any model or Live2D item in the scene. To do that, prepare your model with the ArtMesh colors you want to register, then create a new hotkey of type **"ArtMesh Color Preset"**. Use the **"Record Settings"** button on the hotkey UI to record the current settings. This hotkey can then be used to load/unload that screen/multiply color preset.

You can also create a hotkey of that type with empty settings to create a hotkey that removes the currently loaded color preset for that model.
