## What is this?
You can connect your Twitch account to VTube Studio and trigger various things to happen in the app based on what happens in your Twitch channel.

This will not include functionality like triggering hotkeys, etc. but will be focused on fun, self-contained functionality you can play around with. For more practical Twitch-intagration, please check out the [VTube Studio plugins people have made for Twitch-integration](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Plugins).

## How to use this?

On the first settings tab, scroll all the way down and click "Connect Account". This will open a browser and ask you to authorize VTube Studio. If that does not work, check if you have any anti-virus/firewall software running that might be blocking VTube Studio.

After you've authorized VTube Studio, your account should show up in the app with your profile picture. You can now connect/disconnect using the "Log in and activate" toggle.

You can revoke authorization from VTube Studio in your Twitch settings at any time.

## What can I do with this?

For now, only one thing is supported (but more will be added): dropping emotes posted in your Twitch chat onto your model. You can activate that by clicking the "Config" button. Various cooldown settings can be set from there as well.

This also supports **7TV**, **BTTV** and **FFZ** emotes.
