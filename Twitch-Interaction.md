## Warning

This is a relatively new feature and still in development. It is publicly available but should be considered a **beta** feature for now. Use at your own risk in streams. 

## What is this?
You can connect your Twitch account to VTube Studio and trigger various things to happen in the app based on what happens in your Twitch channel.

This will not include functionality like triggering hotkeys, etc. but will be focused on fun, self-contained functionality you can play around with. For more practical Twitch-intagration, please check out the [VTube Studio plugins people have made for Twitch-integration](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Plugins).

## How to use this?

On the first settings tab, scroll all the way down.
