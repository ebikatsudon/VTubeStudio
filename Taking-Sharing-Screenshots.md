With VTube Studio, you can take screenshots directly from within the app, **save them and share them on social media**. Screenshots are saved as .PNG file. You can also turn the background transparent so only your model and any items in the scene are visible in the screenshot.

Furthermore, you can set up a hotkey to take screenshots using the previous screenshot settings.

On Windows and MacOS, screenshots are saved to your user's "Pictures" folder. On smartphones, screenshots are saved directly to the phone gallery. The app will ask for permission to use this folder. 

Screenshots with transparent background are really useful for producing PNGs of your model that you can for example use in video/stream thumbnails.

On smartphones, you can also directly share your screenshots on Twitter, Discord, etc.
