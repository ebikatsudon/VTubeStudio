# Unsupported Device: Samsung S22 (any type)

Due to an incompatibility with the used tracking library, face tracking will not work on Samsung S22 devices. The library has since been discontinued, so there is nothing I can do to fix this.

I am always looking for replacements for that library, so as soon as I find something, I hope to restore compatibility.

Currently I am looking into bringing Google Mediapipe to the Android version.
