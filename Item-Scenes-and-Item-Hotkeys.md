**Note:** For general information about Items/Assets (custom JPG or PNG images or GIFs you can attach to your model), see the page ["Item System"](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Item-System).

## Item Scenes

You can spawn items (or unload them) via Hotkeys.

This works for items that are attached to the model and items that aren't.

To do this, you first have to create an **"Item Scene"**, which is a collection of items that are turned on/off together. If you just want to turn one item on and off, that _Item Scene_ can just contain that one item.
