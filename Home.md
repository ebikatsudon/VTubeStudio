Welcome to the VTube Studio Manual!

## What is VTube Studio?

**VTube Studio** is an app that uses your smartphone or webcam to track your face and animate a [Live2D Cubism Model](https://www.live2d.com/en/) accordingly. The model can be shown directly on your phone, or the face-tracking data can be streamed over your local network to show the model on your PC.

**NOTE: VTube Studio DOES NOT support 3D models (VRoid/VRM).**

If you have a 3D model, VTube Studio ***WILL NOT*** be suitable for your needs. Consider using [VSeeFace](https://www.vseeface.icu/) for your tracking needs instead. You can use, however, use VTube Studio to control your 3D models in VSeeFace using high quality iOS tracking. [More info on that here.](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/Sending-data-to-VSeeFace/)
