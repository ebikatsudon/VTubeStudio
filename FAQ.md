**No, that can't happen.** VTube Studio uses your smartphone camera just for face tracking and does not store or transmit your face or any raw face tracking data to your PC. Only the calculated parameters are transmitted, so at no point will any video be available on your PC. **The PC/Mac version also has no functionality whatsoever to reveal the webcam video.**

If you also want to make sure your face is never shown on your smartphone screen, make sure to set _"Camera Preview"_ to _"Never Show"_ (see [**"Camera Settings"**](https://github.com/DenchiSoft/VTubeStudio/wiki/VTube-Studio-Settings)).

Don’t worry so much that people could see your face. You are beautiful! ♥

## How do I buy VTube Studio? Why should I? Can I use it commercially?

There are two ways to purchase VTube Studio depending on how you want to use it.
 
* **I want to use iPhone/Android tracking only.**
  * First, download the VTube Studio app from the iPhone or Android App Store. The download itself is free. Then go into the app settings. There's a big button to buy the PRO version.
  * The PRO version gives you access to some features not available in the free version, such as being able to stream to your PC for longer than five minutes and being able to remove the VTube Studio logo in the app.
  * You do not need to purchase anything in the Steam version now, just download it for free and use it. No watermark is shown while using iPhone/Android tracking.

* **I want to use webcam tracking only.**
  * Download on Steam for free and try out the webcam tracking. You will notice a watermark being shown only when the webcam tracking is active.
  * Purchase the "remove watermark" DLC to remove the watermark.

If you want to use both webcam- and iOS/Android-tracking, you’ll have to buy VTS on iPhone/Android and Steam.
