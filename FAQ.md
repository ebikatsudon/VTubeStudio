Once your item is at the correct position, **you can double-tap (double-click) it to lock the position**. That way, you can no longer move, scale or rotate the item until it is unlocked again. If the item is attached to your model, it will still move according to the model movement.

If you move, scale or rotate the Live2D model itself, any locked items attached to the model will also move, scale and rotate with it as you would expect.

**To unlock locked items**, choose the option from the main menu (see arrow in second image). By pressing that button once more, all items will be locked again.

**To delete items from the scene**, simply drag them over the trash can icon in the bottom right. It will only appear if you drag an item near it.

## Item Drag & Drop

On Windows and macOS you can also directly drag items into the VTube Studio window. You can drag them from anywhere on your PC or Mac (any folder, desktop, etc.) onto the VTS window and they will spawn at the center of the scene. They will be set to 0 smoothing and to track the model, so you can attach them afterwards. This allows you to add items to the scene without opening the UI mid-stream.

You can drag in PNGs, JPGs, GIFs and folders containing PNG animation frames, which will be imported as animations. On Windows, you can also drag in multiple files at the same time. Items added later will be placed in front of items added earlier. The limit for the maximum number of items still applies.
