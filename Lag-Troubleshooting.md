This page contains some things to try if VTube Studio lags on your PC.

**Please try all of this before asking in the VTube Studio Discord!!**

## Check your logs

Click the orange "Log" button in the main menu in VTube Studio. Are there any errors? You can also see the full logs by checking the text files in the "Logs" folder next to your "Live2DModels" folder.

Sometimes something will break in VTS and spam the logs with errors every frame, causing the app to slow down a lot. If that is the case for you, please bring it up in the [VTube Studio Discord](https://discord.gg/VTubeStudio).

## Turn off NVIDIA G-Sync

NVIDIA G-Sync can cause issues, especially on multi-monitor setups. [Try turning it off like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+disable+nvidia+g-sync).

* Right-click on your desktop and click on `Nvidia Control Panel` from the menu.
* Click on the `+` next to Display.
* Select `Set up G-SYNC` (not all displays may have that)
* Uncheck the box next to `Enable G-SYNC`.


## Check your security/anti-malware software

If you're running antivirus- or other security-software, make sure VTS is added as an exception. One anti-malware app that is known to cause issues for VTS is "IObit Malware Fighter".




## Reboot

Sometimes, this helps with fixing performance problems.

## Ask in the VTube Studio Discord

If none of that helped, please ask in the VTube Studio Discord by creating a support thread.

- turn off NDI/Virtual webcam
- make sure OBS is up to date
- make sure GPU drivers are up to date
- NVidia G-Sync OFF
- check framerate in VTS -> VSync, etc.

- check task manager for performance issues
- turn off MSI afterburner
- power saving mode
- multi monitor stuff
- steam overlay
