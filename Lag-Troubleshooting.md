This page contains some things to try if VTube Studio lags on your PC.

**Please try all of this before asking in the VTube Studio Discord!!**

## Check your logs

Click the orange "Log" button in the main menu in VTube Studio. Are there any errors? You can also see the full logs by checking the text files in the "Logs" folder next to your "Live2DModels" folder.

Sometimes something will break in VTS and spam the logs with errors every frame, causing the app to slow down a lot. If that is the case for you, please bring it up in the [VTube Studio Discord](https://discord.gg/VTubeStudio).

## Turn off NVIDIA G-Sync

NVIDIA G-Sync can cause issues, especially on multi-monitor setups. [Try turning it off like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+disable+nvidia+g-sync).

* Right-click on your desktop and click on `Nvidia Control Panel` from the menu.
* Click on the `+` next to Display.
* Select `Set up G-SYNC` (not all displays may have that)
* Uncheck the box next to `Enable G-SYNC`.

## Check your security/anti-malware software

If you're running antivirus- or other security-software, make sure VTS is added as an exception. One anti-malware app that is known to cause issues for VTS is "IObit Malware Fighter". Some anti-malware apps can cause VTS to run very slowly, so try deactivating them temporarily and see if that helps.

## Turn of all "performance improvement" apps (MSI AfterBurner, etc.)

Apps like "MSI AfterBurner" that improve game performance may actually cause performance/framerate issues in some cases. Turn them all off and see if that helps. If it does, check if you can add VTube Studio as an exception to those apps (they usually allow that somehow).

## Make sure all software is up to date

Make sure all involved software is up to date. Especially the following:

* Your GPU (graphics card) driver
* OBS or whatever capture software you're using
* VTube Studio on Steam (make sure you're not on the beta branch)

## Reboot

Sometimes, this helps with fixing performance problems.

## Ask in the VTube Studio Discord

If none of that helped, please ask in the VTube Studio Discord by creating a support thread.

First, please check if the lag is actually happening in VTube Studio or only in the OBS capture.


## If you have a multi-monitor setup

If you have a multi-monitor setup, try unplugging one monitor and see if that helps. If so, that could be valuable information for further troubleshooting in the VTube Studio Discord.


- try other capture methods
- turn off NDI/Virtual webcam

- check framerate in VTS -> VSync, etc.
- check task manager for performance issues
- power saving mode
- steam overlay
