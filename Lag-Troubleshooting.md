This page contains some things to try if VTube Studio lags on your PC.

**Please try all of this before asking in the VTube Studio Discord!!**

## Check your logs

Click the orange "Log" button in the main menu in VTube Studio after turning on the webcam in the app. Are there any errors? You can also see the full logs by checking the text files in the "Logs" folder next to your "Live2DModels" folder.

## Try a different USB port

If it's a USB webcam, try plugging it into a different USB port. That sometimes helps.

## Reboot

Sometimes, this helps fix webcam problems.

## Do the Steam integrity check and check your security software

It can happen that security software deletes some files from the VTS directory that are required by the app to work. If you're running antivirus- or other security-software, make sure VTS is added as an exception. One anti-malware app that is known to cause issues for VTS is "IObit Malware Fighter".

To check if all files are there, run the Steam integrity check like this: https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB

## Ask in the VTube Studio Discord

If none of that helped, please ask in the VTube Studio Discord by creating a support thread.
