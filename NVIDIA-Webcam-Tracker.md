This tracker is using GPU-accelerated NVIDIA machine learning technology, which makes it really fast and performant. Even at 60 FPS, the tracker uses very few CPU/GPU resources, so it's able to run smoothly along any other game.

# FAQ

## How does this compare to iPhone/iPad tracking?

## Will this be free?

## What do I need?

The only requirement is a NVIDIA RTX Series GPU. All RTX GPUs are supported, so any RTX 20-series, 30-series or (upcoming) 40-series card will do, including laptop GPUs. GTX GPUs or GPUs from other vendors are not supported. Current Steam surveys show that about 30% of users have RTX cards and that number is increasing with each new NVIDIA GPU generation.

If you are not sure if you have an RTX GPU, please follow [this guide](https://www.tomsguide.com/how-to/what-graphics-card-do-i-have) to find out. If your GPU name starts with "NVIDIA GeForce RTX", you have a supported GPU.
